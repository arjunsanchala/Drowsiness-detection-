## Real-time drowsiness detection.

•	Implemented using OpenCV, Dlib and various statistical formulas. 

•	The facial landmark detection technique was used to track eye movements.

•	The closeness of eyes was identified by a formula called Eye-Aspect-Ratio, and a counter shows the total time of drowsiness.

•	This project is beneficial for real-time video calling apps like zoom, skype, and google meet, where the host can identify the number of people who are not interested/fell asleep.

•	The robust program accurately detected eyes regardless of illumination, quick face movements and distance to the camera.
